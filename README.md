## Overview

This project is a **visual clone** of the official Capgemini website. The main goal is to **recreate the visible design and layout** of the website using **HTML, Tailwind CSS**, and a bit of basic JavaScript for interactivity. No real website functionality (like backend, forms, or APIs) is implemented — the focus is purely on the **front-end appearance and responsive design**.

---

## Features

- Fully responsive layout using **Tailwind CSS**
- Multi-section homepage (Hero, Services, Industries, Insights, Contact)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsiveness

---

## Learning Goals

- Practice using Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive layouts.
- Improve understanding of UI design and structure.
- Strengthen skills in HTML semantics and front-end organization.

---

## Notes

- This project is for **educational purposes only** — not an official Capgemini product.
- Branding, logos, and real content should be replaced if shared publicly.
